How to Run the Game: 
1) To open the game, follow the link to https://repl.it/@murphyci/Mastermind-Game2#main.py. 
2) Click on the Run button at the top (this tends to run slow and the first time you press Run, it loads all of the associated programs and exit on its own. It may take two or three times of pressing Run for it to work.)
3) The game is on when a picture with eight rows of 4 circles appears on the top right corner of the webpage. 
4) To start playing the game, first place your mouse cursor on the picture and click on it. This focuses the code on the board. Now you can begin.
5) Press on the Up arrow on your keyboard to start looking through your options for colors. They are: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Purple and Orange. You can also press the Down arrow to go back to any previous color in the list. 
6) Once you select a color, press the Right arrow key to move one space right and fill in the next circle by repeating step 5. You can use the Left arrow key to go back one to the left if you need to change a circle.
  ** Do not press the Left arrow if you are on the far left circle of the row. 
7) Once you have four colors in a row selected, press Enter/Return
  ** Do not press Enter/Return if you do not have all four circles filled with a color. If any circle in the current row is white when you press enter, you will need to press Run to start a new game.
8) After you press Enter, up to four circles will apper to the right of the row you are currently on. These mean:
    1) Black Circle - this means that a guess you made is both the right color and in the correct position in the row
    2) White Circle - this means that a guess you made is the right color but it's in the wrong position
    3) If a spot remains grey with no circle, this means that a guess you made is the wrong color and isn't on the board at all. 
    
9) You have eight attempts(the amount of rows) to correctly guess the solution based on the feedback the circles in step 8 give you. 
10) If you get the correct answer(4 black pegs on the right) before or on the eight try, you win! You'll see a congratulatory message in the bottom left corner of the screen.
11) If you do not guess the correct answers after hitting Enter/Return for the eighth time, you will lose and see a similar message in the bottom left corner of the screen. 
12) After three seconds after a game is won or lost, the game will exit.
13) To play another round, press Run again and repeat steps 4 - 11.
